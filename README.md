# Hellicarrier React and Graphql
React
Graphql
Tailwindcss

## Running the App

1. Start by cloning the repo

2. Navigate into the cloned repo and install all the dependencies with `npm install`

3. Open two terminal from the directory. One for the react app `npm start` and the second for the graphql mock api `npm run mock:api`

## Decisions and Shortcut

Some of the decisions i made is to write functions in the frontend that do the heavy lifting of `Filtering by Status, Type and Searching` because there is no how that can be achieved with the graphql mock api i used,
unless there is a graphql server that is buiit, which will allow to do nomerious things.
